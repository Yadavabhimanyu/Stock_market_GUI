# Hello and Welcome !.
## The aim of this project is to provide users help to avoid losses and invest wisely.This project has been developed as a POC.


- __A brief explaination about the methodlogy used:-__
   - The model has been trained on the publically available stock price data of Banks .
   - The model uses Linear regression to predict the Highest and Lowest Price of the stock.
   - After the data is collected, the data is then pre-processed for the model.
   - The model then predicts the outcome as an arrray of two elements which are numerical values.


- __Task performed:-__
The classical Machine Learning task like data exploration,feature engineering,model buiding, model testing,Hyperparameters tuning etc.
- __Deployment:-__
The model has been deployed locally using Tkinter as GUI for Desktop App while MySQL is used as databse to store the predicted values .
- __Model:-__
Model used here is Linear Regression.
- __Accuracy:-__
The model has a r2 score close to 90.00%.
-__IDE:-__
Spyder
